# The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Wave 1 data
Most of this analysis needs to be run on an HPC due to lack of memory on a local machine.
The time and memory utilization for the analysis is as follows:
09:06:38
Memory Utilized: 553.70 GB
Memory Efficiency: 92.28% of 600.00 GB


## Running EDA
The EDA is run using the `eda_compute.py` script. The script is run on an HPC using the following command:
```bash
sbatch HPC_run_all_eda.sh
```

# pyroptosis_live-cell_timelapse

This repo contains code that processes and performs image-based profiling on single-cells in live-cell timelapse imaging data of pyroptosis in SH-SY5Y cells.

## Data
We have collected multiple datasets:
### Wave 1:
This wave 1 data is preliminary and generated to identify the best conditions for imaging pyroptosis in SH-SY5Y cells.
More specifics about Wave 1 data can be found in the [Wave1_data/README.md](Wave1_data/README.md).
